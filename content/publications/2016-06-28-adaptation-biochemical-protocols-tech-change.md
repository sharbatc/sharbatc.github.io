# Adaptation of Biochemical Protocols to Handle Technology-Change for Digital Microfluidics

## Abstract

This work addresses the challenge of adapting biochemical protocols when underlying microfluidic technology changes, ensuring protocol compatibility and reliability across different digital microfluidics platforms.

## Key Contributions

- Novel adaptation strategies for protocol migration
- Technology-agnostic protocol representation
- Validation framework for adapted protocols
