  We describe the organization and pedagogical approach of Neuromatch Academy (NMA), an online school that taught computational neuroscience to 1757 students from 59 countries in 2020. NMA was designed with global accessibility as a core principle, and we evaluate its success using quantitative metrics of inclusion and student experience.

# Neuromatch Academy: Teaching Computational Neuroscience with Global Accessibility in Mind

This paper describes the design and implementation of Neuromatch Academy (NMA), an innovative online educational platform that successfully taught computational neuroscience to nearly 1,800 students worldwide during 2020.

## Key Contributions

### Global Accessibility Framework
We developed and implemented a comprehensive framework for making computational neuroscience education globally accessible, addressing barriers such as:
- Time zone differences through asynchronous and flexible synchronous components
- Economic barriers through free access and computational resources
- Language barriers through multilingual support and translated materials
- Technical barriers through cloud-based computing environments

### Pedagogical Innovation
The curriculum combined:
- Interactive tutorials using Python and computational modeling
- Small group projects with peer mentoring
- Global networking opportunities across diverse academic backgrounds
- Open-source materials for continued learning and reuse

### Impact Assessment
Our quantitative evaluation demonstrated:
- Successful engagement of students from 59 countries
- High completion rates across diverse demographic groups
- Positive learning outcomes measured through pre/post assessments
- Strong community building and international collaboration

## Significance

This work represents a landmark effort in democratizing access to computational neuroscience education. The success of NMA during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the viability of large-scale, globally accessible online education in STEM fields, providing a model for future educational initiatives.

The project's emphasis on open science principles, community-driven development, and global inclusion has influenced subsequent educational programs in neuroscience and beyond.
