# Biomechanics and posture control in zebrafish: implications for human health

This study establishes zebrafish as a powerful translational model for understanding fundamental principles of posture control and their applications to human health and disease.

## Research Objectives

### Comparative Biomechanics
We aimed to characterize the biomechanical foundations of postural control in zebrafish and identify conserved mechanisms relevant to human physiology.

### Translational Applications
The research focused on developing insights that could inform therapeutic strategies for human balance disorders and rehabilitation protocols.

## Methodology

- High-resolution 3D motion capture of swimming zebrafish
- Real-time analysis of postural adjustments and corrective responses
- Multi-camera systems for comprehensive kinematic analysis
- Integration with electrophysiological recordings

### Biomechanical Modeling
- Development of mathematical models for postural control
- Finite element analysis of musculoskeletal dynamics
- Machine learning approaches for pattern recognition
- Comparative analysis with human postural control data

## Key Discoveries
