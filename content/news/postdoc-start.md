I'm happy to announce that I've started my postdoctoral position in the team of Dr. Tihana Jovanic at the Institut de Neurosciences Paris-Saclay (NeuroPSI) on the 1st of February, 2025.

This new position allows me to continue my research into the neural mechanisms of behavior while expanding into new areas of circuit neuroscience. I'll be working on understanding how neural circuits process sensory information to generate appropriate behavioral responses.

The transition from my PhD work on zebrafish to _Drosophila_ larvae should be interesting, given my background. Perhaps I shall, at the back of my mind, keep thinking about the similarities and differences between vertebrate (fish) and invertebrate (insect) neuroscience?

Looking forward to new and interesting science and collaborations.
