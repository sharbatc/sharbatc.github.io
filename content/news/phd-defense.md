I've successfully defended my PhD thesis, on the 13th of December, 2024! ðŸŽ“

After four years of research at the Laboratoire Jean Perrin, I presented my work on "" to my PhD thesis defense committee at Sorbonne UniversitÃ©.

## The Journey

This PhD has been a journey of discovery, challenges, and growth. From learning to work with zebrafish larvae to light-sheet microscopy, from debugging experimental setups to analyzing terabytes of imaging data - it was a ... roller-coaster ride, perhaps similar to what I subjected my larval zebrafish to.

## Acknowledgments

I'm grateful to:
- My supervisor Dr. Volker Bormuth for his guidance and support
- My thesis committee for their valuable feedback
- All lab members who made this journey memorable
- My family and friends for their unwavering support

The PhD thesis (and resulting preprints and publications) are now available in the publications section. On to the next chapter as a postdoc!
