Welcome to my (Sharbat's i.e. Sharbatanu Chatterjee's) homepage! I am about to start as a postdoctoral researcher in Paris. I got my PhD (Docteur de Sorbonne Université) from the [Laboratoire Jean Perrin](https://www.labojeanperrin.fr/) of Sorbonne Université, Paris - a laboratory that puts me at the interface of biology and physics, under the supervision of Dr. Volker Bormuth. I was enrolled at the [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) under the doctoral school (école doctorale) in physics, called [EDPIF](https://www.edpif.org/en/), i.e. l'École doctorale physique en Île-de-France.

What do I do?
------
I broadly work in the field of neuroscience - to try and figure out how brains lead to behaviour. For my PhD, I studied the control of posture or balance, with the help of the model animal - zebrafish. I recorded the behaviour and brain-wide activity of zebrafish while moving them around on a ~~roller coaster~~ rotating light-sheet microscope. My PhD thesis and publications will soon be available online!

I have previously worked on rodent behaviour (at the [SWC](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/), [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)), computational neuroscience (during my master's at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), computer science, (during my bachelor's at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/)), etc. My current research uses various techniques from my previous work!

What else do I do?
------
I am interested in languages, travel, history, political theory, science communication, & immigration. I blog on languages & linguistics, travel, & history. I co-organise a reading group on political theory. I regularly participate in communicating science to the wider public, & highlight the role of immigration & immigrants in science.

Where do I come from?
------
I was born in the banlieues (suburban areas) of the city of Calcutta (West Bengal, India). I spent my first 18 years there, and subsequently moved to Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh, India), Lausanne (Vaud, Switzerland), and London (United Kingdom), before moving to Paris (France) where I currently live. I got married in the 'city' of Groningen, the Netherlands. I don't know where I exactly come from anymore. Je me sens chez moi nulle part (thanks, Saint Levant).
